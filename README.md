# MP3Organizer

May 8 2018

Allows users to maintain each user's collection of MP3 song files

Program ability:
- Open and View the entire collection
- Add to the collection
- Search by each of 4 categories
- Sort by each of 4 categories
- Create a backup of the collection
- Delete an entry from the collection
- Recommend a song from the collection
- Allow multiple users to create other databases as well
- Switch between users
The database includes at least three characteristics of each entry in the collection (Example: Song Title, Artist, Category, etc.)
 

The program uses methods, arrays, file handling, searching and sorting and concepts from object-orientating programming to ensure the functionality of the over-all program and its neat user interface.
